###  System Architecture


```
[Frontend (Next.js)]
       |
[Sanity CMS] ---> [Product Data API]
       |
[Third-Party APIs] ---> [Shipment Tracking API]
                        ---> [Payment Gateway]
```
#### Data Flow:
1. Customers browse food items on the frontend.
2. Product details are fetched from Sanity CMS.
3. Orders are processed via the checkout system and stored in Sanity CMS.
4. Delivery updates are retrieved using the shipment tracking API.

#### 2. Browsing Menu Items
- Customers view food categories and items.
- Data is dynamically fetched and displayed via Sanity CMS.

#### 3. Placing an Order
